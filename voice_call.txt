Host the twiml.xml file on a publicly accessible web server. One way to do this is by using GitHub Pages:
Create a new GitHub repository.
In the repository, create a new branch called gh-pages.
Add the twiml.xml file to the root of the gh-pages branch.
Push the changes to the gh-pages branch.
Your twiml.xml file will now be hosted at the following URL: https://your_github_username.github.io/your_repository_name/twiml.xml
Update the Python script to include the twiml_url variable with the URL of your hosted twiml.xml file:


twiml_url = 'https://your_github_username.github.io/your_repository_name/twiml.xml'

In the Python script, replace the relevant code where the twiml_url is used. Since you're using MessageBird in
the previous examples, you'll need to switch to using Twilio to make voice calls using TwiML.
You can follow this guide to learn how to make voice calls with Twilio in Python.

note that this example demonstrates hosting the twiml.xml file using GitHub Pages,
but you can host it using any web server or hosting service that allows you to serve static files with
a publicly accessible URL.
